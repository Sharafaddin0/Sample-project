The context of the dataset:

Tech firms are facing an economic slowdown, marked by reduced consumer spending, higher interest rates, and a strong dollar. 
This downturn has led companies like Meta to lay off employees, with Meta cutting 13% of its workforce (over 11,000 jobs). 
This dataset aims to analyze the tech industry's recent challenges and trends after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Cleaning followed by following steps:

1. check for duplicates and remove any
2. standardize data and fix errors
3. Look at null values and see what 
4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary

About Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Here we are jsut going to explore the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers
normally when you start the EDA process you have some idea of what you're looking for with this info we are just going to look around and see what we find!
